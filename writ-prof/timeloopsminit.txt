    <h1>Minit: A Subversion of Gaming Tropes</h1>
    <p>It is no secret that gaming as an entertainment medium has evolved exponentially over the years. My personal gaming habits started with <em>The Sims</em>, a game that was entertaining enough to keep me engaged for long hours in one sitting. Non-narrative games like <em>Minecraft</em> and multiplayer shooters reinforced my habit of enjoying non-linear gameplay through my teenage years. However, like many students, there comes a time when hobbies take a backseat to studies. For years, I thought I had grown out of gaming until <em>Minit</em> (2018) drew me back in and showed me how games can be presented in novel ways.</p>

    <p><em>Minit</em> takes around two hours to finish. At $5 on launch, it features art direction a step above <em>Pong</em> (1972), repetitive music, and a core mechanic akin to the plot of <em>Groundhog Day</em> (1993). Despite these seemingly underwhelming elements, <em>Minit</em> makes bold statements through its gameplay, repetition, and procedural mechanics. The game transforms the concept of death in video games from a penalty into a utility—a tool for learning rather than an obstacle to overcome. This is achieved through its unique application of procedural rhetoric.</p>

    <h2>Procedural Rhetoric in Video Games</h2>
    <p>Game critic Ian Bogost introduces the concept of procedural rhetoric in his book <em>Persuasive Games</em> and article <em>The Rhetoric of Video Games</em>. Procedural rhetoric refers to the ability of video games to persuade players through the execution of processes, rules, and tasks. Unlike traditional media such as books or films, video games uniquely allow player input, defined here as the literal pressing of buttons rather than discourse.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>“By designing the rules of literary composition, Oulipian writers share much in common with children on a playground: first they create a possibility space, then they fill that space with meaning by exploring the free movement within the rigid structure of literary rules.” (Bogost, <em>Rhetoric of Video Games</em>, 121)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Understanding how video games simulate environments and interactions within them is critical to procedural rhetoric. Games convey messages through repeated tasks the player is persuaded to complete, dictated by both the simulation and its constraints.</p>

    <h2>Death as Utility in <em>Minit</em></h2>
    <p>The core mechanic of <em>Minit</em> is its cursed sword, which causes the player-character to die every 60 seconds, restarting from their starting point. Unlike traditional games where death is a penalty, <em>Minit</em> integrates death as a tool for progress. Jacques Lacan’s writings on the death drive provide a framework for understanding this mechanic.</p>

    <p>Lacan’s concept of <em>jouissance</em>, or the paradoxical enjoyment tied to the end of desire, parallels the curse in <em>Minit</em>. The game prevents the ultimate end (death) from being avoided or fully embraced, instead forcing the player to use it as a procedural mechanic.</p>

    <h3>Pacing and Player Learning</h3>
    <p>The timed lives in <em>Minit</em> directly influence its pacing. For instance, an early puzzle involves listening to a slow-talking old man near a lighthouse. The player quickly realizes they must allocate their limited time wisely, rushing to objectives while also practicing patience when needed. This invisible tutorial effectively teaches players to value their actions within constraints.</p>

    <h3>Death Drives in Gaming</h3>
    <p>In contrast to shooters like <em>Call of Duty</em>, where death is strictly penalized, <em>Minit</em> redefines the role of death. The forced repetition persuades players to adapt and learn, demonstrating how procedural rhetoric can create meaning through mechanics rather than narrative alone.</p>

    <p>The final challenge in <em>Minit</em>, facing the CEO of the polluting corporation, exemplifies this dynamic. Multiple steps are required to defeat the enemy within the time limit, forcing the player to apply all they’ve learned through the game’s mechanics. This Freudian interpretation of the death drive—separating it from sexual drives—emphasizes death as a utilitarian function rather than a cathartic end.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p><em>Minit</em> demonstrates the potential for video games to subvert traditional mechanics and tropes, transforming death from a penalty into a procedural tool. Its innovative gameplay and application of procedural rhetoric make it a standout example of how games can persuade and engage players in novel ways.</p>
