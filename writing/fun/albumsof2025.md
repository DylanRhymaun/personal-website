# Introduction
First of all, thanks for reading. I made an effort this year to listen to as many albums in full as comfortably possible - it paid off in terms of exposing me to a lot of new artists, but most of all I also learned a lot about my relationship to music and art as well as the role of a critic. This Summer I spent countless days biking out to quieter beaches along Lake Champlain and simply wading in the water with my headphones on, having the time of my life. At the same time, I found myself dissatisfied with my understanding of the album format, noticing more and more the cracks in the work of criticizing a collective of 10-20 songs. I realized a 10/10 album is borderline impossible with music. Even my favorite album of all time, Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly, has songs I would skip. That begs the question, should an album be treated like a collective of songs, or more like a movie? In my opinion, you must choose the latter. “Mortal Man”, the 12 minute closer of TPAB, is a song I’ve only listened to a handful of times. Would I want it removed from the album? Of course not, that’s like removing the end of Interstellar after Cooper escapes the 4th dimension. My point is this, albums are not the ideal format for experiencing music, but they are a necessary format for creating further meaning behind the collection of songs being released. It's relatively common for at least one song on an album to be close to perfect, but creating the perfect album requires a level of cohesivity that is difficult in the medium of music. In my opinion, It requires a tight direction of lyricism and instrumentation that many artists fail to take notice of. 
I found myself talking a relatively ton of shit about the albums in this list, even up to the top 10. for that reason. As a final note, I want to stress that the vast majority of these albums are good and worth listening to despite whatever critiques I point out.  Hence, I based my rankings on a mix of quantitative objectivity and vibes.  Richard WIlliamson is an art advisor (whatever that means) with a decent following on social media. I ran into one of his videos where he described how he judged art based on Novelty, Nuance (how much work went into it), and Narrative (how much of a story is conveyed through the piece). I thought this was a pretty concise and effective way of judging art, but I threw in 3 bonus points to give at my discretion to boost albums I enjoyed despite not scoring high from an objective perspective. I also assigned letter grades to the final score, though I was much more liberal than traditional American letter grading (80 is an A-).
