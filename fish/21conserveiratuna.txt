<p>I don't mean to gas this up too much but this is the most enthusiastic I've been about a tin, and I eat a lot of canned fish. It doesn't look pretty and it fell apart easily, but this stuff had a distinct sweet flavor to it that was just amazing and unlike any meat I've tasted before. Perhaps some of that may have to do with the "light" tuna designation (whatever that means) but I'd put money on the source of the catch. <br>10/10 definitely check it out if you see it.</p>
