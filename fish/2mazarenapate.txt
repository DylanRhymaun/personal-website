<h2>Nazarena Conservas Spicy Sardine Pate</h2>

<p>Relatively flavorless and boring, believe it or not. It's literally mashed up sardines and it tastes as much. I paired it with manchego and multigrain crackers, but that wasn't a good pairing to be honest. It would be much better on a sourdough with something to cut through the fattiness. <br> 5/10</p>
