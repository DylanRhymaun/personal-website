<h2>Faerosk Laks No 1. Faroe Island Salmon</h2>

<p>This was easily the prettiest piece of meat I've found in any tinned fish but wow was I let down. I drained off most of the oil and ate over rice and it was dry as a desert. The flavor was not offensive but it was borderline unedible as is. I ended up adding some seaweed, mayo, and Sriracha just to get it down. <br>I'd be willing to try it again on a sandwich with lots of roughage since the filet was so intact, but as is, eaten in the plainest way possible, it was rough. <br>3/10 because I see potential. </p>
