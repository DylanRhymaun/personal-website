<h2>Nuri Mackerel & Seed to Surf Celery Root Whitefish</h2>
<img class ="gallery" alt="desc" src="images/fish/nurimackerel.jpg">
<p>Nuri is one of those brands you just have to trust is solid. This was no exception. Fish was light and flavorful. My only complaint was that the olive oil could have been stronger. The packaging implied that it was olive-forward, but it tasted almost like water. <br> The "whitefish" on the other hand, was a total dud. It appeared to be lightly marinated in soy sauce, and packaged with some kombu at the bottom of the can. Texture was lighter than raw celery root because it was cooked, but nowhere near an imitation of fish. <br>Mackerel: 7/10 <br>"Whitefish": 1/10 </p>
