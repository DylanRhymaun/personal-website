<p>Pretty good for the first expensive canned fish I've tried. I ate this before writing proper reviews for cans so this one is a bit of a retrospective. Canned tuna - not light tuna - has a distinct density in cans which tends not to vary much. This is not different, but you can't complain much. It was flavorful, and would pair well with pretty much anything you can think of. <br> 7/10</p>
