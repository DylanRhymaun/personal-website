<h2>Trader Joe's Alaskan Pink Salmon</h2>

<p>Saw this for $4 and just had to pick it up. In terms of quantity, this is a pretty unbeatable deal. That said, I'm struggling to find many use cases for this outside salmon salad. Still, it tasted fine enough to eat out of the can. Definitely not something many normies would want to eat, but not something I'd tell a seasoned canned fish lover to avoid. Flavor wasn't super strong but not unappetizing. The larger chunks could easily pass for higher quality if prepared and plated right. I'll try again some day by making them into crab cake-like things. <br>6.5/10</p>
