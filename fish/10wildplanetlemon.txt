<h2>Wild Planet Sardines in EVOO w Lemon</h2>

<p>I've had probably 30 cans of the regular olive oil tins this year, and have only had a sub-excellent experience once when the skin was unusually thick on one fish. Hopefully Costco keeps them on shelves forever 🤞🏽. This was my first time trying another variation from the brand, and it didn't dissapoint. Fish quality was the same, and while the lemon was hardly there, it still changed the overall flavor enough for me to be satisfied. I'd say these are on par with my go-to tin from them. <br>9/10?</p>
