<p>I like this brand but this one was a bit of a let down. In short, it was bland and dry. Zero spice or flavor in the oil to where I would've guessed it was canola instead of evoo. I can't complain about the amount of fish though- it was certainly filling, and made a decent dinner when buffed up with Sriracha mayo and furikake. <br>5.5/10</p>
