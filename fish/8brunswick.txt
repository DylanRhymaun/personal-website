<h2>Brunswick Brisling Sarines w Jalapeno</h2>

<p>TIL that brisling sardines are different species from common sardines. I guess it's my fault, but even still, these were dreadful and I can't pinpoint why. Maybe it was the oil being cheap, the texture being absolute mush, or the flavor being just generally unpleasant/unnatural. Fwiw I tried them twice. Once on pizza (baked with some leftover slices), and another on pasta. Neither was pleasant. That said, I give credit that they packed as many fish in the tin as they did. At least you get 15 sprats for $3.  <br>1/10</p>
