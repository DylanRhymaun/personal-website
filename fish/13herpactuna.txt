<h2>Herpac Yellowfin Tuna Belly</h2>

<p>Definitely one of the best tins I've had. I'm not even sure what part of the fish this is from but it's not like any other canned filet I've had (obviously, the belly, but point to the belly of a tuna). Dense and stringy are the two words that come to mind, and while that doesn't sound very appetizing, I assure you it works. It also had a really strong and unique flavor. Almost earthy with a hint of lemon (no lemon added). I ate it straight up over rice and would do so again. Retails for $14 USD. Pricy, but worth trying if you're interested. <br>10/10</p>
