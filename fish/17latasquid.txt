<h2>Lata Stuffed Squid in Ink</h2>
<img class ="gallery" alt="desc" src="images/fish/latasquid.jpg">
<p>This was my first time trying squid and squid ink and it was a cool experience! It tasted like a sort of tomato sauce with sea water but it wasn't bad at all. The squid itself was the best part. I think it implies it was stuffed with onion but it was more appealing than that sounds - gave it a full, natural, meaty texture throughout. In the future I'd get this again with a tomato sauce but it was neat to try out. <br>7.5/10 but I couldn't eat it often due to the saltiness.</p>
