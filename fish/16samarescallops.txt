<h2>Samare Scallops in Galician Sauce</h2>

<p>I was hyped for this tin. I like restaurant style scallops a lot, but these fucking sucked! I wasn't expecting a Gordon Ramsey sear but come on. The flavors were mid at best, with a slight sweetness brought down by the boring sauce, and the scallops themselves were tiny to the point where if I didn't see the box, I'd put money down that they were clams. Also very disappointing because (1) it was $12 and (2) the product looks incredibly different from how it appears online. <br>Avoid at all costs 2/10. Not a 1/10 because I finished it. </p>
