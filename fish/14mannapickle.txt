<h2>Manna Sardines in Pickling Sauce</h2>
<img class ="gallery" alt="desc" src="images/fish/mannapickle.jpg">
<p>I've had quite a few Manna brand sardines and they've all been at least good (lemon and thyme mackerel is my GOAT). These are probably my least favorite due to the sauce, but it was carried by the quality of the fish.

I still don't really know what made this pickling sauce. It did taste a bit like they mixed brine with the tomato sauce, but I'd be surprised if that was a thing. It says vinegar, but that just sounds gross. In short, it tasted like a normal tomato sauce with a bit more salt and  acid than usual. Dines were thick and meaty - no complaints there.

6.5/10. I wouldn't purchase again but it was far from bad. </p>
