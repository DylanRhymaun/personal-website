<p>I've only had octopus 3 times before, but this was better than when I had it at an upscale restaurant. Surprisingly tender and flavorful, with a decent quantity per can. The sauce was more of an oil with spices thrown in than a sauce, but it did it's job. Overall I highly recommend this can. <br>I got it as a gift but it retails for between $12-$16. I wouldn't buy it again due to both the ethics and the price but it WAS one of the best canned seafoods I've had. <br>9/10</p>
