<h2>Acore Salmon & Porto Muinos Sea Spaghetti</h2>

<p>I had high hopes for the salmon because I enjoyed the Açôr tuna do much, but while it had good flavor and texture, I found it very oily and NOT worth the $14 price tag. You could get 3x the meat for that price and feel better about it. <br>The sea spaghetti retails for $7 and I would not recommend it unless you have plans for what to pair it with. I expected it to have a bite because of the garlic shoots, but it had the texture of overcooked pasta which was interesting. You could cut through it with a spoon. I also expected more seaweed and/or garlic flavor, but all I tasted was oil. <br>Together though, they somehow made up for each other's lackings. The seaweed added a nice sense of freshness go the salmon, and the salmon added the fishy flavor I associate with seaweed. Hard to describe in many ways, but the combination over rice was 8/10. 7/10 for the Salmon and a generous 3/10 for the seaweed individually. </p>
