<p>These were actually pretty good! Really not much to say about them other than that they had a very strong flavor and a totally normal texture for what you'd expect from clams. Threw them and some of the brine into a sausage leek and clam pasta thing. <br>7.5/10 but could be 8 or 9 if used properly. </p>
